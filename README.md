## 🚀 My Complete Backend Development Journey

I started learning backend development from an amazing YouTube series called **[Chai aur Backend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH3vGeqeIAo&list=PLu71SKxNbfoBGh_8p_NS-ZAh6v7HhYqHW)** by **[Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.hiteshchoudhary.com/)** on his channel **[Chai aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode)**.

This series helped me build a solid foundation in backend technologies using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and more.
